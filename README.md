# OpenCVMotionDetection
Lucas Kanade Optical Flow algorithm implementation and get delete moving wall effect.

# Introduction
Draw optical flow vector on the rog doll's hand that in the biped1 video. Delete movable wall's effect and find true optical flow vector in the biped2 video.

# Usage
python3 LucasKanade.py for only optical flow
python3 FilterWall.py for optical flow with background
python3 FilterMovableWall.py for optical flow with movable background
